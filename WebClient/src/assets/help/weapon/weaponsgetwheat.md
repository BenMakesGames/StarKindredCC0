When a Vassal with a Scythe finds Weapons, they will also receive Wheat.

---

_There are many stories about scythes. One says that they have a magical aura that keeps the farmer's crops from being touched by hungry animals. Another says that the first scythe was created by an old woman wandering around the forest, in the dark. She found a black cherry tree full of shiny fruit and thought to herself, "I mustn't waste those, for they're just so well-formed." And she took a stone knife from her belt and whittled it down into the shape of a scythe, in order to cut the cherries down._
