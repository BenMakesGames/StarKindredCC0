Whenever a Vassal completes a Mission while equipped with a Weapon that _could_ have been useful, 1 Durability is lost from that Weapon.

When a Weapon has no durability left, it is unequipped, and must be repaired before it can be equipped again.

A Weapon can be repaired at any time by sacrificing another Weapon of the same type. (An Axe can be used to repair another Axe, for example.)
